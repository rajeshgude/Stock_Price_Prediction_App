Project Explanation – Stock Price Prediction App  link --- https://stockpricepredictionapp-n7asmqzusxjpczpz7hjsvw.streamlit.app/
________________________________________
1. Project Overview
    This project aims to predict stock prices based on historical data using Linear Regression. The app allows users to visualize stock trends and predict the next day's price, helping investors make better decisions.

2. Tools and Technologies Used
    1.	Python Libraries:
        o	Streamlit: For building the web interface.
        o	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
        o	NumPy: For numerical computations.
        o	scikit-learn: For machine learning (Linear Regression model).
        o	Matplotlib & Plotly: For data visualization.
    2.	GitHub: To store and manage code.
    3.	Streamlit Cloud: For deploying the application online.

3. Project Architecture
   The app is divided into two main components:
    1.	Backend (model.py):
        o	This part handles the machine learning logic (training the Linear Regression model).
        o	It loads historical stock data, trains the model, and makes predictions.
    2.	Frontend (app.py):
        o	This part handles the user interface using Streamlit.
        o	It displays stock trends, allows users to input stock data, and shows the predicted price.

4. Key Code Walkthrough
    Backend: model.py
    The machine learning part is implemented using Linear Regression. Here’s how it works:
        1.	Data Loading and Preprocessing:
            o	Stock data (open, high, low, close prices, and volume) is loaded using Pandas.
            o	Data is cleaned and prepared for modeling.
        2.	Training the Model:
            o	We extract relevant features (like previous day’s open, high, low, volume) as input features.
            o	The closing price is used as the target variable.
            o	We split the data into training and test sets.
    Frontend: app.py
        1.	Setting Up Streamlit Interface:
            o	The app uses Streamlit to upload stock data and display visualizations.
        2.	Displaying Stock Trends:
            o	The stock data is shown in both tabular format and graphs using Plotly.
        3.	User Input and Prediction:
            o	Users can select stock data and see the predicted next day’s closing price.

5.Model Training Process
    The model used is Linear Regression, which finds the relationship between the input variables (open, high, low, volume) and the target variable (closing price).
    1.	Input Features:
        o	Last day’s open, high, low, and volume prices.
    2.	Target Variable:
        o	Next day’s closing price.
    3.	Why Linear Regression?
        o	Simple to implement and interpretable.
        o	Works well for continuous data, like stock prices.

6.Deployment Process on Streamlit Cloud
    Explain how you deployed the app:
    1.	Code on GitHub:
        o	Pushed the code to a GitHub repository.
    2.	Streamlit Cloud Setup:
        o	Logged into Streamlit Cloud with my GitHub account.
        o	Created a new app and connected it to the GitHub repository.
    3.	App Deployment:
        o	Selected the app.py entry point.
        o	Deployed the app successfully, and the URL was generated.

7.Challenges Faced and Solutions
    1.	Model Input Error:
        o	Faced shape issues when passing inputs to the model.
        o	Solution: Used np.array to reshape the input properly.
    2.	Deployment Errors:
        o	Faced missing dependencies during deployment.
        o	Solution: Added required packages in the requirements.txt.
    3.	Visualization Issues:
        o	Faced issues displaying the graphs initially.
        o	Solution: Used Plotly for better visualization in Streamlit.
